        - Bugfix in test scripts, that makes test fail randomly
        - Major feature enhancements
            (DIRECTIVE|SECTION) METHOD
            - directive() now returns full list of directives, sorted
              as it comes in the file. Each element of this list is
              an object that points to the directive entry.
            - directive(Foo) also returns a full list of value of all
              "Foo" directive in current context, also sorted as it comes
              in the file. Each list's element is also an object that
              points to the directive entry.
            - directive(Foo, Bar) returns an object that points to the
              last directive (if more than one) wich has the same
              directive's name/value. In list context, it returns the
              full list of same directive's name/value.
            - directive() can now takes the -which=>N parameter to
              select the entry's number to return (if exists).
            ADD_(DIRECTIVE|SECTION) METHOD
            - can take 4 parameters:
                - -before=>target  where target is an Apache::Admin::Config
                  object, that points to a section or directive of the same
                  context than add_directive() method's object caller. The
                  directive if added just before the target.
                - -after=>target idem but after the target.
                - -ontop  added on the top of current context.
                - -onbottom  added on the bottom of current context.
        - Internal parser modification that allows a section to have
          same name than a directive in the same context without no clash.
        - New methods (see documentation for more details):
            - first_line: return the first line of rule pointed by caller object
            - last_line: return the last
            - lines: return all lines occuped by the rule
            - dump_line: dump a line
            - isin: true if caller object is in the same context than one given in argument
            - type: return the type of caller object
            - name: return the name of caller object
        - API had change, so contructor can take the -oldapi=>1 argument for
          a backward compatibility

        - Make a quick and dirty documentation
        - value() return the context value if no arguments given

          argument in this case
