SYNOPSIS

        # or

DESCRIPTION
    "Apache::Admin::Config" provides an object interface to handling Apache
    like configuration files without modifying comments, identation, or
    truncated lines.

METHODES
  NEW
        $obj = new Apache::Admin::Config [/path/to/file|handle], [-indent => $integer]

    Create or read, if given in argument, an apache like configuration file,
    and return an Apache::Admin::Config instence.

    Arguments:

    *"/path/to/file"*
        Path to the configuration file to parse. If none given, create a new
        one.

    *"handle"*
        Instead of specify a path to a file, you can give a reference to an
        handle that point to an already openned file. You can do this like
        this :

            my $obj = new Apache::Admin::Config (\*MYHANDLE);

    *-indent* => *$integer*
        If greater than 0, activates the indentation on added lines, the
        integer tell how many spaces you went per level of indentation
        (suggest 4). A negative value means padding with tabulation(s).

  SAVE
        $obj->save([/path/to/file|HANDLE])

    Write modifications to the configuration file. If a path to a file is
    given, save the modification to this file instead. You also can give a
    reference to a filehandle like this :

        $conf->save(\*MYHANDLE) or die($conf->error);

  DUMP_RAW
        $obj->dump_raw

    Returns the configuration file as same as it will be if it saved in a
    file with the save() method. If you don't call this method from the top
    level section, it returns the part of the configuration file that is
    under the object's context.

  SELECT
        $obj->select
        (
            [-type  => $type],
            [-name  => $name],
            [-value => $value],
            [-which => $index],
        );

        @directives    = $obj->select('directive');
        @sections_foo  = $obj->select('section', 'Foo');

    This method search in the current context for items (directives,
    sections, comments...) that correspond to a properties given by
    arguments. It returns a list of matched objects.

    This method can only be called on an object of type "section". This
    method search only for elements in the section pointed by object, and
    isn't recursive. So elements in sub-sections of current section aren's
    seek.

    Arguments:

    "type"
        The type of searched item.

    "name"
        The name of item.

    "value"
        Value of item.

    "which"
        Instead of returns a list of objects, returns only ones pointed by
        index given to the -which option. Caution, returns an empty string
        if none selected, so don't cascade your methodes calls like
        $obj->select(-which=>0)->name.

    Method returns a list of object(s) founds.

  DIRECTIVE
        $obj->directive(args...)

    Same as calling select('directive', args...)

  SECTION
        $obj->section(args...)

    Same as calling select('section', args...)

  COMMENT
        $obj->comment(args...)

    Same as calling select('comment', args...)

  BLANK
        $obj->blank(args...)

    Same as calling select('blank', args...)

  ADD
        $obj->add
        (
            $type, [$name], [$value],
            [-before => $target | -after => $target | '-ontop' | '-onbottom']
        );

        $obj->add('section', foo => 'bar', -after => $conf_item_object);
        $obj->add('comment', 'a simple comment', '-ontop');

    Add a line of type *$type* with name *foo* and value *bar* in the
    context pointed by $object.

    Aguments:

    "type"
        Type of object to add (directive, section, comment or blank)

    "name"
        Only relevant for directives and sections.

    "value"
        For directive and section, it defines the value, for comments it
        defined the text.

    "-before" => *target*
        Inserts item one line before *target*. *target* _have_ to be in the
        same context

    "-after" => *target*
        Inserts item one line after *target*. *target* _have_ to be in the
        same context

    "-ontop"
        Insert item on the fist line of current context;

    "-onbottom"
        Iinsert item on the last line of current context;

    Returns the added item

  ADD_SECTION
        $obj->add_section(args...)

    Same as calling add('section', args...)

  ADD_DIRECTIVE

  ADD_BLANK
        $obj->add_blank(args...)

    Same as calling add('blank', args...)

  DELETE
        $item->delete;

    Delete the current context pointed by object. Can be directive or
    section.

  SET_VALUE
        $obj->set_value($newvalue)

    Change the value of a directive or section. If no argument given, return
    the value.

  VALUE
    Return the value of rule pointed by the object if any.

    ("value" and "set_value" are the same method)

  MOVE
        $obj->move
        (
            -before => target |
            -after => $target |
            -replace => $target |

  LAST_LINE
  ISIN

    by $section_obj. If "-recursif" option is present, true is also return
    if object is a sub-section of target.

        <section target>
